# EventTrackerProject

## Description

This application was built to facilitace UI with my the database I created with SQL Workbench called pgdadb. It utilize REST API to perform basic CRUD and Index functions. The purpose of this application is to create a UI that allow the user to read and organize data relating to PDGA current tournament statistics and international rankings. 

## Technology Used

Postman
Gradle
MAMP
Github
Mysql
Sublime
MacOS terminal
Java . Microsoft Word
UML
Zoom, Slack
Tomcat Server
Chrome browser
MySQL Workbench
Languages: Java, MYSQL, Groovy

## Project Goals

- Basic CRUD verified through Postman. 
- Build an organized MySQL database that takes into acount for future tables expansion.
- Deepen my understanding of the REST api relationships with the required controllers, services and entities.
- Develop a better skill for troubleshooting these new processes and have an idea of where to look from cosole logs. 

## Lessons Learned
Starting with entities to services then finally controllers is my preferes flow while programing this process. Junits are essential functions and relate directly to next step of postman verification. I didn't necessarily see the conneciton before but I do now. I have gone fomr hating them to indiferent in my feelings towards them, to feeling a need to create them to ensure my mapping and data connections are working. I have a amuch better understanding of the overall structure and flow in this process and was able to trouble shoot a lot on my own. I continued to utilize TA hours which is always a big help whe I get completely stuck. Overall I can see the progress in how much better I understand how this all works together.   

## Coding Time and Testing
03 May - 1500- 1930 Initial stubbs built out. V1 pushed to GitHub with only C built out. 
04 May - 1100- 1700 V2-4 Pushed with Basci CRUD and index verified by Postman. MVP goals met
05 May - 2000-2200 V5 - Final version of the application MVP verified and README.md finished

## Further Planned Expansion
- Create  method and mapping for (find by name, tournament paticipant list, tournament ranking, find by League)
